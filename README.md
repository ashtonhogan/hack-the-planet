#### Testing open ports

Check the [pentest wiki](https://github.com/nixawk/pentest-wiki/blob/master/3.Exploitation-Tools/Network-Exploitation/ports_number.md) for services commonly running on each port.

| Port Number | Actions and Common Vulnerabilities                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 80, 443     | - **Service Enumeration and Version Detection**: Use `nmap -sV -p 80,443 <target-ip>` to detect service versions.                                                                                   |
|             | - **Checking for Misconfigurations**: Visit HTTP/HTTPS pages for default pages or error messages. Use tools like `gobuster` to find hidden directories and files.                                   |
|             | - **SSL/TLS Configuration and Security**: Use `sslscan <target-ip>:443` or `testssl.sh` to check for weak ciphers, outdated protocols, and certificate issues.                                      |
|             | - **Vulnerability Scanning**: Run tools like `Nikto`, `OpenVAS`, or `Nessus` to find known vulnerabilities.                                                                                         |
|             | - **Web Application Testing**: Perform manual and automated tests using tools like `OWASP ZAP` and `Burp Suite` to check for vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and file inclusion.      |
|             | - **Exploitation (if permitted)**: Search for public exploits with `searchsploit nginx <version>`, and consider creating custom exploits if necessary.                                              |
|             | - **Privilege Escalation**: Look for server misconfigurations, files with incorrect permissions, and attempt to upload web shells if possible.                                                      |
|             | - **Reporting**: Document findings, provide detailed reports, and give remediation recommendations.                                                                                                |
|             | - **Common Vulnerabilities**: Default pages, directory listing, weak SSL/TLS configurations, SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion, and outdated software vulnerabilities.                       |
| 443         | - **SSL/TLS Configuration and Security**: Assess SSL/TLS strength using `sslscan <target-ip>:443` or `testssl.sh`.                                                                                  |
|             | - **Checking for Misconfigurations**: Look for weak ciphers, outdated protocols, and certificate issues.                                                                                            |
|             | - **Common Vulnerabilities**: Weak ciphers, outdated protocols, self-signed certificates, and SSL/TLS misconfigurations.                                                                            |
| 80          | - **Service Enumeration and Version Detection**: Use `nmap -sV -p 80 <target-ip>` to detect service versions.                                                                                        |
|             | - **Checking for Misconfigurations**: Visit HTTP pages for default pages or error messages. Use tools like `gobuster` to find hidden directories and files.                                          |
|             | - **Common Vulnerabilities**: Default pages, directory listing, exposed configuration files, and outdated software vulnerabilities.                                                                 |
| Any Port    | - **Service Enumeration and Version Detection**: Use `nmap -sV -p <port> <target-ip>` to identify services and versions.                                                                            |
|             | - **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**: Use tools like `OpenVAS`, `Nessus`, or `Nikto` to scan for vulnerabilities.                                                                                 |
|             | - **Manual Testing**: Manually test identified services for vulnerabilities specific to the detected service (e.g., FTP, SSH, SMTP).                                                                |
|             | - **Privilege Escalation**: Look for misconfigurations, incorrect file permissions, and other weaknesses that could allow privilege escalation.                                                     |
|             | - **Common Vulnerabilities**: Service-specific vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated software, misconfigurations, weak passwords, open directories), and privilege escalation opportunities.              |

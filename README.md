|             | - **Manual Testing**: Manually test identified services for vulnerabilities specific to the detected service (e.g., FTP, SSH, SMTP).                                                                |
|             | - **Privilege Escalation**: Look for misconfigurations, incorrect file permissions, and other weaknesses that could allow privilege escalation.                                                     |
|             | - **Common Vulnerabilities**: Service-specific vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated software, misconfigurations, weak passwords, open directories), and privilege escalation opportunities.              |
